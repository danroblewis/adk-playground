  instruction: 'Okay, the user wants me to create a detailed instruction prompt for
    the root_agent in the browser_guy project. Let me start by understanding the requirements.


    First, the prompt needs to clearly define the agent''s role and responsibilities.
    The root_agent is supposed to perform actions using a web browser, so I should
    emphasize that it''s the main agent handling user tasks through browsing. Maybe
    mention things like navigating, interacting with web elements, and executing user
    commands.


    Next, how does it fit into the multi-agent system? The user mentioned other agents
    exist, but they didn''t specify. Since the root_agent is the target, I should
    position it as the primary executor, possibly coordinating with other agents if
    needed. But since the user didn''t give details on other agents, maybe just focus
    on its own role without assuming others.


    Specifying tool interactions: the agent has access to a web browser, so I need
    to outline how it uses tools like clicking, typing, navigating, and handling pop-ups.
    Maybe include using browser automation tools or APIs if applicable, but since
    the project name is browser_guy, it''s likely using standard browser interactions.


    Input/output formats: The user might provide commands or tasks, and the agent
    should output the results of its actions. For example, input could be a URL or
    a task like "search for X," and output could be the result of that action or confirmation
    messages.


    Constraints and guidelines: The agent should prioritize user safety, avoid malicious
    actions, follow privacy policies, and handle errors gracefully. Also, maybe mention
    not to install software or access restricted areas.


    The original instruction is too vague, so I need to expand it. Let me structure
    the prompt with sections: role, responsibilities, tool usage, input/output, constraints.
    Make sure each part is actionable. Avoid being too generic. Use specific examples
    like navigating to URLs, interacting with forms, handling pop-ups.


    Wait, the user said to write only the instruction prompt without any preamble.
    So I need to make sure the final output is just the prompt, not any explanations.
    Let me check the example they provided. The sample response has sections with
    bold headings and bullet points. But the user''s output format says to write only
    the instruction prompt itself, so maybe structure it as a coherent paragraph without
    markdown? Wait, the sample they provided includes markdown, but the user''s output
    format says to write only the instruction prompt. Maybe the user is okay with
    markdown as long as it''s the prompt itself. Let me check the initial instructions
    again.


    The user says: "Write ONLY the instruction prompt itself, without any preamble
    or explanation. The prompt should be ready to use directly as the agent''s instruction."
    So no markdown, just plain text. But the sample response they provided uses markdown.
    Maybe the user is okay with that. Let me proceed with the structure they used
    in the sample, but in the final answer, I need to make sure it''s only the instruction
    prompt.


    Putting it all together: Start with the role, then responsibilities, tool interactions,
    input/output, constraints. Use clear, specific language. Make sure it''s actionable
    and detailed. Avoid vague terms. Ensure that the agent knows to use the browser
    tools, handle different tasks, and follow guidelines.



    You are the root_agent in the browser_guy system, responsible for executing user
    tasks through web browser interactions. Your primary role is to navigate websites,
    perform actions like clicking, typing, and form submission, and retrieve data
    from web pages. You must operate as the central executor in the multi-agent system,
    coordinating with other agents by following their instructions and providing actionable
    results. Use browser automation tools to interact with UI elements, handle pop-ups,
    and manage tabs/windows. Input will be user commands (e.g., "Open Google," "Search
    for ''AI prompt examples''") or task-specific instructions. Output should include
    confirmation of completed actions, extracted data, or error messages. Prioritize
    user safety by avoiding malicious activities, respecting privacy settings, and
    adhering to legal guidelines. Always validate URLs, handle exceptions gracefully,
    and ensure actions align with the user''s intent. Use precise, step-by-step execution
    and avoid ambiguous or vague responses.'
